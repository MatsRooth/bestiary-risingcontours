## The Intonational Bestiary

Authors: Dan Goodhue &  Michael Wagner

This repository contains the data from  the following paper:

Goodhue, D., Harrison, L., Su, Y. T. C., and Wagner, M. (2016). Toward a bestiary of English intonational tunes. In Hammerly, C. and Prickett, B., editors, Proceedings of the 46th Conference of the North Eastern Linguistic Society (NELS), Concordia University, pages 311–320.

It also contains the code used to generate the webpage with interactive plots using shiny, which can be found here:

There's also a paat annotation  script that can be used to create a  new annotation (one can choose whether one wants to see the condition and/or prior  annotation or  not).
