## The project

This page provides a first glimpse of our current project, which aims at creating an 'intonational bestiary'. By this we mean respository of mini-corpora which help establish the inventory of intonational tunes of North American English (and, in the long run, hopefully of some other languages) 

Below, you can browse the data from a scripted production experiment and listen to the individual utterances. We hope this will be useful for training people to recognize certain tunes. Of course, you might very well disagrree with our classification--if so, let us know!  If you would like to get access to the data and maybe even provide your own annotation, contact us!

The approach we took in the data set posted on this page is to collect data in scripted dialogues that are relatively controlled with respect to the intentions of the characters involved, and to see which intonational tunes speakers (who are not aware that the experiment is about intonation) actually use to convey these intentions.

Are tunes like sentences with meaningful phonological pieces that compose an overall meaning? Or are they like mono-morphemic words, whose phonological components are not themselves meaningful? This is one of the questions we hope to make progress on by collecting this type of data set. For now, the utterances are annotated only for which tune was used. We decided to treat tunes as holistic contours, rather than treating them as decomposable into smaller meaningful units, since this scheme lead to high inter-annotator agreement. This is not meant to imply the tunes cannot be decomposed into meaningful parts.  

The utterances were also normed in perception experiments by naive listeners who rate their naturalness in different contexts. These mini-corpora can then become a point of reference for future studies. They can also be a testing ground for different types of analyses of intonational tunes.

The experiment reported on this page aimed at establishing which intonational contours speakers speakers use to convey three particular intentions, given a context and a scripted response. Speakers were not told that it is the choice of intonation that we were interested in. 

A first write-up of the study with more details was published here: 

*Goodhue, D., Harrison, L., Su, Y. T. C., and Wagner, M. (2016). [Toward a bestiary of English intonational tunes](http://prosodylab.org/~chael/papers/Goodhue-et-al_NELS_2016.pdf). In Hammerly, C. and Prickett, B., editors, Proceedings of the 46th Conference of the North Eastern Linguistic Society (NELS), Concordia University, pages 311â€“320*


The three types of dialogues each tried to elicit a certain type of response, either a contradiction, an indirect implication, or an incredulous response. The limitations of this study are numerous, for one thing the dialogues were scripted, so speakers could not choose their own words. We think the results are nevertheless interesting... 

Thanks to the many people who helped with this experiment, especially our participants how gave us permission to publish these recordings! Also thanks to SSHRC and NSERC for providing funding for this research!

## Three types of intent

There were 9 item sets each consisting of three dialogues with identical target sentences, which varied in the prerecorded context and the stage directions provided to the participant. 


## Our experiment


* Scripted dialogues 
* Participants are asked to act out three particular intentions
* We 'implant' these intentions by providing stage directions, in addition to a script
* We want to to see which tunes speakers choose (they are not told that the experiment is about intonation)
* The recordings are annotated by trained annotators
* And also subjected to perception experiments



### Context 1: Intended Contradiction


**Emma:** Jim was just asking me if I've seen Manuel, and I told him I don't know any Manuel. 

<audio controls="controls" src="data/audio/contRecord_1_7_3.mp3">
</audio>

*[Stage directions: You know for a fact that your friend knows Manuel because you are all in the same biology class together. So you're very surprised by what she says, and your answer should reflect that.]*

**Participant's Response**: You know Manuel

<audio controls="controls" src="data/audio/contour_1323_7_1.mp3">
</audio>


### Context 2: Intended Implication


**Emma:** The concert tonight is all sold out and I didn't get a ticket yet! I wish I knew someone who worked there who could get me in.

<audio controls="controls" src="data/audio/contRecord_3_7_3.mp3">
</audio>

*[Stage directions: You know that your friend is friends with Manuel, who just got a job at the concert venue a couple of weeks ago, and you want to suggest that he could help, even if you don't know for sure whether he could.]*

**Participant's Response**: You know Manuel

<audio controls="controls" src="data/audio/contour_1617_7_3.mp3">
</audio>


### Context 3: Intended Incredulity


**Emma:**  I just talked to Manuel, we're going to meet up later. 

<audio controls="controls" src="data/audio/contRecord_2_7_3.mp3">
</audio>

*[Stage directions: You told your friend earlier today that you need to get in touch with Manuel, but you didn't know how to contact him. At the time she just shrugged and didn't offer any help, so you assumed she didn't know him. So you're very surprised by what she says, and your answer should reflect that.]*

**Participant's Response**: You know Manuel
